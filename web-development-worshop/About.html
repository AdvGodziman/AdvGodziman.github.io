    <BR> <BR> <H1>ABOUT ME</H1>
  <P> As you all know by now, I am Advik Chakraborty. I was born on 9th October 2010 in India. 
    I was born in a Bengali family. When I was 3 years old, I started my school journey in a pre-school which is <A HREF = "https://www.littlekidz.org/">Little Kidz</A> in Bangalore. 
    After I passed UKG (Upper KinderGarden), I joined <A HREF = "https://vis.edu.in">Venus International School</A> in Bangalore. From 1st Grade to 6th Grade, I was in Venus International School. 
    After 6 years, my father transferred to Singapore, where I joined GIIS Smart-Campus in Punggol. Currently, I am in 8th Grade and working hard to maintain my Academic Proficiency. 
    I have many hobbies. Some hobbies are Playing Cricket, Playing Chess, Singing, Dancing and working with Technologies. 
    I like technologies because it is an interesting and vast concept which can be used to help everyone. I am Kind and have many friends till now. 
    I aspire to become a cricketer and a Software Engineer. Well, that's all about me for now, but do visit other sections of my portfolio Webiste.  </P>
