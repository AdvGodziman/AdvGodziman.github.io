    <p align = "right">The GSA (Global School Awards) is an event for honouring the achievements of students who worked hard in various categories (Academics, Co-Curricular Activities, etc.) for the year.
        In the year 2022-23, I got two awards for Academic Excellence - 2nd Position in Prof. M.G.K. Menon Award, and 3rd position in Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Award. These awards were honoured upon me by Ms. Melissa Maria, the Principal of <a href = "https://singapore.globalindianschool.org/smart-campus">GIIS Smart Campus - Punggol</a>. 
        It was my first year in GIIS Smart Campus and everyone gave their efforts in Academics, Co-Curricular Activities like Culinary, Dance, Radio Jockey and Extra-Curricular Activities like Cricket, Basketball, Football and more to earn this honour. 
        I had scored 3rd position in Class CBSE 7-A, with 94.5 overall percentage. </p> <BR>  <BR>  <BR>   <BR>   <BR>

     <p> The ACSIS U-12 Cricket Tournament is an Inter-School Tournament where people who are interested in Cricket give their selection trials to their respective schools and these schools play against each other. 
             The team which scores the highest points wins Gold Medal, the second highest point-scoring team gets Silver Medal, and the third highest point-scoring team gets Bronze Medal.
             We (GIIS U-12 Team) secured second position with 1 Win, 1 Loss and 1 No Result, and got <em>Silver Medals</em>. Our coach <A HREF = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munish_Arora>Munish Arora</A>is an excellent coach who trained us for the matches, helped us to cope up from our loss, and taught some cricket batting, bowling and fielding techniques too. This was my first achievement in Sports.</p>
