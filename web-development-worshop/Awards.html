    <p>"The GSA (Global School Awards) is an event for honouring the achievements of students who worked hard in various categories (Academics, Co-Curricular Activities, etc.) for the year.
        In the year 2022-23, I got two awards for Academic Excellence - 2nd Position in Prof. M.G.K. Menon Award, and 3rd position in Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Award. These awards were honoured upon me by Ms. Melissa Maria, the Principal of <a href = "https://singapore.globalindianschool.org/smart-campus">GIIS Smart Campus - Punggol</a>. 
        It was my first year in GIIS Smart Campus where everyone give their efforts in Academics, Co-Curricular Activities like Culinary, Dance, Radio Jockey and Extra-Curricular Activities like Cricket, Basketball, Football and more." </p>
